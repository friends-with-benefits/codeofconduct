### **Scope**

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by or related to an individual&#39;s status as a member of Friends With Benefits. This includes (but is not limited to) the Discord server itself, IRL FWB meet-ups and events, Metaverse spaces, and collaborative platforms utilized for FWB projects like Miro, Notion, Figma, and Google Docs. Violations of this code outside of these spaces may also affect a person&#39;s ability to participate within them.

The FWB Code of Conduct applies equally to all members of the community, including staff.

### **Reporting An Issue**

Users who wish to report an issue can open a ticket using the [submission form](https://airtable.com/appkkMQpokyJYLa8N/pagDFht5wNKUqUaUf/form).

Our community council will review the submission as promptly as possible and address the issue to the best of its abilities. You may be contacted by the community council email to ask for additional details.

### **Moderation Procedures**

The FWB community council is made up of community members that have volunteered and been approved to help evaluate conflicts, with an eye towards reaching resolutions that uphold the community&#39;s values and that reach towards a restorative approach rather than a punitive one as much as possible.

There will be under a confidentiality agreement to protect the privacy of parties involved in disputes, and will also be expected to recuse themselves from mediating any issues in which they have a conflict of interest.

Moderator decisions are issued in written form by a Mediator that does not partake in the moderation process directly. They serve as a neutral liaison and point of contact for involved parties.

Decisions can be appealed through the same Mediator, providing members a second chance at explaining a situation to a second set of approved moderators who were not involved in the initial decision. There is only one appeal allowed per case.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant continues to engage in harassing behavior, the admins may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the server.
